    which shall be conducted in accordance with the HKIAC's arbitration rules in effect at the time of applying for
    arbitration.</dd>
  <dd>(2) Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in
    court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a
    court can award. You agree that, by agreeing to this Agreement, you and we are each waiving the right to a trial by
    jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and
    the termination of your licenses. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. All issues are for the
    arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration agreement.</dd>
  <dd>(3) YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT
    AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and we
    agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims with your claims, and may not
    otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be
    unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void. The arbitrator may award
    declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent
    necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. </dd>

    version of any other language, the English version shall prevail. </dd>
  <dd>(2) You may not assign or transfer this Agreement or any rights granted hereunder, by operation of law or
    otherwise, without the prior written consent of WPS Office, and any attempt by you to do so, without such consent,

    this Agreement will be without prejudice to its other remedies under this Agreement or otherwise. </dd>
  <dd>(4) The failure by either party to enforce any provision hereof will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement
    of that or any other provision. </dd>
  <dd>(5) If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable or invalid, it will be executed to the fullest
    extent possible, whilst the other provisions shall remain in effect.</dd>
  <dd>(6) This Agreement constitutes the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between the parties with
    respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior proposals, understandings or communications regarding
    this subject matter, verbal or written, unless you and WPS Office have executed a separate agreement (For purpose of
    clarity, the purchase order or ordering documents described below do not constitute separate agreements). Any terms
    or conditions contained in your purchase order or other ordering document that are inconsistent with the terms and
    conditions hereof are hereby rejected by WPS Office and will not apply.&nbsp;</dd>

    such revisions and should review this Agreement periodically to determine the then current terms and conditions to
    which you are bound.</dd>
  <dd>(8) If you are using any part or whole of the Software and accepting the terms hereof on behalf of any non-natural
    person , such as company or any other legal entity or any unincorporated organization, you represent and warrant
    that you have the authority to bind such non-natural person to the terms hereof, and, in such event, "you" or "your"
    will refer to such non-natural person. If you do not accept all the terms hereof as set forth above, WPS Office is
    unwilling to license the Software to you, and you shall not install or use the Software . If WPS Office has made the
    Software available to you without charge, then you must immediately stop using the Software with no refund. In
    either case you must destroy all copies ( if any) of the Software.</dd>
  <dd>(9) As noted above, WPS Office may modify or alter this Agreement at any time. In addition, WPS Office may provide
    additional terms and conditions via the Software or the Official Website and your use of the Software (and/or any
    acknowledgment of such additional terms and conditions) constitutes your acceptance of any such additional terms and
    conditions. Any amendment to this Agreement by you must be agreed to by us in writing (excluding email) and executed

    the permitted transfer of the Software and not as a separate transaction.</dd>

    of the Software licensed to you, shall apply both this Agreement and the separate end user license agreement of
    Equation Editor resources pack (End User License Agreement of Design Science) which you must acknowledge and
    agree to prior to use of the Software with Equation Editor. A link to the End User License Agreement of Design
    Science is set forth below. Where any inconsistency exists between the two license agreements, the provisions
    which are more protective of Design Science and WPS Office shall prevail.</dd>
